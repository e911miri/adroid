## About Adroid
This project was an attempt for us to create an communication application for the `Confab of Aces`. 
It is built using Google App Engine. After a while, it was used as the backend for the Android Africa Challenge entry.
It is pretty basic and contains a lot of bugs

## How to use
To submit the application for the android adc, we want the application to perform the following tasks.

1) Register a service, To do that, make a json post to coaafrica.appspot.com/apis/svc/new containing the following parameters:
title = db.StringProperty()
desc = db.TextProperty()
location = db.GeoPtProperty()
time = db.DateTimeProperty(auto_now_add=True)
extras = db.TextProperty()
category = db.StringProperty()   
mode = db.StringProperty(choices=MODE_KEYS) Mode can either be fixed or variable
Categories is a list of Categories is displayed Category is Gotten from coaafrica.appspot.com/apis/svc/new 

2.) Browse for Categories, to retireve categories, make a get request to `coaafrica.appspot.com/apis/cat`, you'll get a list of all categories entered in the database

3. Browse for Services in a category: To do that, make a get request of this format `coaafrica.appspot.com/apis/browsecat/<category title>`

3. retrieve a Service by passing in its key in this format `coaafrica.appspot.com/apis/browse/<category title>/<service key>`
