Hi Wande...
To submit the application for the android adc, we want the application to perform the following tasks.

1. Register a service, To do that, make a json post to coaafrica.appspot.com/apis/svc/new containing the following parameters:
		title = db.StringProperty()
		desc = db.TextProperty()
		location = db.GeoPtProperty()		Representes as a string eg "3.11212, 3.233443" 
		time = db.DateTimeProperty(auto_now_add=True)
		extras = db.TextProperty()
		category = db.StringProperty()   A list of Categories is displayed Category is Gotten from coaafrica.appspot.com/apis/svc/new
		mode = db.StringProperty(choices=MODE_KEYS) Mode can either be fixed or variable

2. Browse for Categories, to retireve categories, make a get request to coaafrica.appspot.com/apis/cat, you'll get a list of all categories entered in the database

3. Browse for Services in a category: To do that, make a get request of this format coaafrica.appspot.com/apis/browsecat/<category title>

3. retrieve a Service by passing in its key in this format coaafrica.appspot.com/apis/browse/<category title>/<service key>
